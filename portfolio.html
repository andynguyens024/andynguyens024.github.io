<h2> Reflection Piece</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> We made this game to spread awareness about these two competing games. The inspiration comes from the countless hours in playing those games.</p>
        <p> One sucessful point is how we inputted the Roblock background into our home screen. Another sucessful point is how we added a flamethrower aspect to inflict continuous damage.  </p>
        <p> One obstacle is time and how my parter and my time didn't align. Another obstacle was trying to get the fire to align with the sprite. We overcame this by searching up how to do the algorithm oursleves.</p>
        <p> If we had more time, we would add more levels and more high quality photos.</p>
        <hr>
        <p> It is algorithm because it a series of steps.This algorithm shows how we can reduce the health of the Boss.</p>
