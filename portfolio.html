<h2> Reflection Piece</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> We made this game to spread awareness about these two competing games. The inspiration comes from the countless hours in playing those games.</p>
        <p> One sucessful point is how we inputted the Roblock background into our home screen. Another sucessful point is how we added a flamethrower aspect to inflict continuous damage.  </p>
        <p> One obstacle is time and how my parter and my time didn't align. Another obstacle was trying to get the fire to align with the sprite. We overcame this by searching up how to do the algorithm oursleves.</p>
        <p> If we had more time, we would add more levels and more high quality photos.</p>
        <hr>
        <p> It is algorithm because it a series of steps. This algorithm shows how we can reduce the health of the Boss.</p>

<h1 id="Story">Crazy Wealthy AsianZ</h1>
        <p> This is a story between two star-crossed lovers, Bill and Mirabelle, who begin dating. Mirabelle faces criticism from Bill's family because she was an American. Mirabelle and Bill both make decisions that determine whether they get married or get separated.</p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1mQvAraogEtLeiW-OZKyrUsl2B-7WKVDHz92qufrGwhc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_BLANK"><img src ="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1mQvAraogEtLeiW-OZKyrUsl2B-7WKVDHz92qufrGwhc/edit?usp=sharing"></a>
        <p>During the incremental process of the program, we made our story based off of three decisions. We also determined the settings andthe characters in each scene, and we gradually plotted actions that would ultimately affect the outcomes of the story. During the iterative development process, we returned to the story and added descriptions. A difficulty I faced was accessing the “repl” that my partner worked on; we resolved this by communicating with each other of what times we were available. Another difficulty was adding quotation marks and any special characters to our text which was quickly resolved by finding where our other apostrophes were placed and adding “\”..</p>
        <p>Procedural abstraction is introduced by organizing each scene since different parts of the story provides the user a story of what will happen. When separated into functions, the reader has the oppotunity to create his or her own ending and scenes. The advantage is that it allows the reader to see each program.</p>
        <p>A story I admire is the story of Cinderella. This story is similar to Crazy Wealthy Asianz. Cinderella is similar to Mirabelle and left. Prince Charming attemptted to find her to return back her slipper, just like Bill. The passion for each other resonates to me as I am still trying to find a wholesome significant other, particularly one that can do chores.</p>
